Laura Ling's tutorial suggestions
=================================

Part 1:

For beginners, the models are little confusing. If we start off displaying an empty database, go through the model excerises. Then, open the database and we can see what the ORM codes are doing ie creating tables and new records or poll questions.
It is more a cause and effect approach. Models emphasizes that this is a Django abstraction of the database layer.

Part 2:

Creating Choice -- Clearer instructions in how to get the choice form. I had to follow the breadcrumb. You jump from Question to Choice without any navigation instructions.

Templates -- We couldn't find admin/base_site.html. Since we are working in virtualenv, the instructions are helpful.

Part 3 and Part 4:

Modifying Code -- Clearing instructions in where to modify, add or delete codes (ie line number). Do we add all the "from and import bottom" of list? Where do we add new codes (ie def). Is there a particular order in a class or outside the class?
A before and after screenshots would helpful.
